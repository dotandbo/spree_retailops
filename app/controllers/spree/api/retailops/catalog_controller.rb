      #         {
      #             "sku":"ASDF",
      #             ...more properties, all optional except for sku and varies...
      #             "varies":true,

      # One important subtlety here is that RetailOps will always send one or
      # more variants, even in the degenerate case where there are no options.
      # We do a transformation here if there are no options, making the variant
      # data go to the master variant.
      #
      # The catalog_push method returns a list of errors which are associated
      # with specific objects, for RetailOps to display as feed errors.  We track
      # the current object using a correlation ID so that add_error and add_warn
      # can associate errors with the correct thing.
