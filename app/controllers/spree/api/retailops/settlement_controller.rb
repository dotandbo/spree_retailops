        # "Settlement" subsystem - called by ROP when there are large changes in the status of the order.
        #
        # * First we add zero or more "packages" of things we were able to ship.
        #
        # * Then we flag the order as complete - this means ROP will not be shipping any more.  Often everything will have been shipped.  Sometimes not.  Oversells and short ships are af will add a negative
        #   adjustment if the order was short shipped.  Depending on
        #   configuration this may also cause automatic capturing or refunding of
        #   payments.
        #
        # * Then (later, and hopefully not at all) we can add refunds for
        #   inventory returned in ROP.

        # Package adding: This reflects a fairly major impedence mismatch
        # between ROP and Spree, insofar as Spree wants to create shipments at
        # checkout time and charge exact shipping, while ROP standard practice
        # is to charge an abstraction of shipping that's close enough on
        # average, and then decide the details of how this order will be
        # shipped when it's actually ready to go out the door.  Because of this
        # we have to fudge stuff a bit on shipment and recreate the Spree
        # shipments to reflect how ROP is actually shipping it, so that the
        # customer has the most actionable information.  A complication is that
        # Spree's shipping rates are tied to the shipment, and need to be
        # converted into order adjustments before we start mangling the
        # shipments.  Credit where due: this code is heavily inspired by some
        # code written by @schwartzdev for @dotandbo to handle an Ordoro
        # integration.

        # ships by modifying the order itself, then refunding by the difference
        # between the new order value and the payment.  The core code itself
        # handles returns by creating an Adjustment for the returned
        # merchandise, and leaving the line items alone.
