      # Much simpler than catalog sync (and intended to be faster).  Note that
      # the SKU need not exist, and inventory updates will be silently ignored if
      # the SKU does not exist.  This is because when a product is received, one
      # or more catalog and inventory updates are generated, which race, and we
      # may receive the inventory update before the catalog task has created our
      # variant.  Since the catalog process also updates inventory, it's harmless
      # to just ignore this.
