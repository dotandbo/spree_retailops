      #
      # When an order is being actively managed by the RetailOps integration, we want a consistent price between systems, so when an order is managed we combine
      # all of the shipment prices into a single price which is used on the RetailOps side and also stashed on the order, either as a global adjustment
      # (matching historical spree_retailops behavior, and arguably more correct for multi-shipment orders) or as the price on one of the shipments (arguably
